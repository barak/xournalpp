License: CC-BY-SA-2
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
 YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
 SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
     "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative
     Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
     dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
     recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
     adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
     License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
     a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.  "Licensor"
     means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
     terms of this License.  "Original Author" means the individual or
     entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the copyrightable work
     of authorship offered under the terms of this License.  "You"
     means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from
     the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.  "License Elements" means the following
     high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
     indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
 other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
     to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to
     distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
     Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
     perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
         composition: Performance Royalties Under Blanket
         Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
         whether individually or via a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance
         or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
         Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
         Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
         Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
         compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
         Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
         Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance
         of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
         performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
         the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
         subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section
         114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
         jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
     You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
     License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
     Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
     publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
     the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
     not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
     not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
     control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
     the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
     the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
     to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
     the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
     Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
     Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.  You may
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
     License, a later version of this License with the same License
     Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license
     that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy
     of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
     license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
     not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
     or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise
     of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all
     notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
     perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with
     any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
     in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
     Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as
     incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
     Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License.  If you distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
     or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
     all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author
     credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
     conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
     Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
     extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
     unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
     licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a
     Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
     Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
     Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
     other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at
     least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
     License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
     Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
     or entities remain in full compliance with those
     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
     termination of this License.  Subject to the above terms and
     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
     as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
     a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
     to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
     granted to You under this License.  Each time You distribute or
     publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to
     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  If
     any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.  No term or provision of this License shall
     be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
     consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
     with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes the entire
     agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
     here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations
     with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be
     bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without
     the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

License: CC0
 Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
 LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
 ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
 USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
 DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
 OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
 rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
 data in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
 the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
 benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
 Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
 not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
 the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement
 of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
 exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
 effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
 any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
 extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
 persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 this CC0 or use of the Work.
